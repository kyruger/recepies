        <h3>How To Make It</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First of all, let's take the (grape leaf) vine leaves into the water and let them wait for the salt to come out.
                 The more salty it is, the better it is to keep it for as long as you can even change the water and let it stand again. 
                 When I'm going to wrap it, I take out the leaves a few hours in advance and put them in water.</li><br/>
            <li>Let's take the olive oil in the pot and fry the onions, peanuts and currants that we chopped for cooking.</li><br>
            <li>Let's add sugar and fry until the onions become transparent.</li><br>
            <li>Let's add the washed rice and continue roasting.</li><br>
            <li>Let's add tomato grater, salt and spices and mix.</li><br>
            <li>Add the water and cook over low heat until the filling is drained. And let's get the mortar from the stove.</li><br>
            <li>Let's mix it by adding the parsley you chopped small.</li><br>
            <li>Now we can move on to wrapping the grape leaves.</li><br>
            <li>Let's lay the grape leaves on a flat place.
                 Let's put the inner material inside according to the size of the leaf so that there is not too much in it.</li><br>
            <li>Let's close the sides and wrap them like cigarette rolls.</li><br>
            <li>Let's arrange the grape leaves we wrapped in the pot in an orderly way.</li><br>
            <li>After sorting all the leaves, let's place lemon slices on them.
                 Let's squeeze the juice from half a lemon. Let's add olive oil and sugar.</li><br>
            <li>Let's add enough water to cover the wraps.
                 (About 1.5 cups were enough in my pot) and let's cover it with ascending leaves, 
                 if any. You can also use a fountain stone, so the dolmas will be cooked more beautifully and evenly with steam.</li><br>
            <li>After boiling, let's cook over low heat until the water is drained, checking the water frequently.</li>
